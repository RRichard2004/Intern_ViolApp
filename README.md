# Intern_ViolApp

## 2 Week Intern Project

This project is a 2-week intern project, developed together with its [counterpart.]([https://github.com/RRichard2004/Intern_EduApp])

## Key Features & Benefits

*   **Potentially a cross-platform application:** Leveraging technologies like Ionic/Capacitor.
*   **Modern JavaScript Framework:** Utilizes a modern JavaScript framework (likely React with TypeScript) and Node.js.
*   **Automated Testing:** Implements Cypress for end-to-end testing.
*   **Android Support:** Includes Android platform setup.

## Prerequisites & Dependencies

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:**  [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **npm:** (Comes with Node.js)
*   **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
*   **Ionic Extension for VSCode:** (Install in VSCode marketplace)
*   **Android SDK:**  (Required for Android development)
*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** (Required for Android development)
*   **Git:** [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation & Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RRichard2004/Intern_ViolApp.git
    cd Intern_ViolApp
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Ionic Globally** (If you haven't already)
    ```bash
    npm install -g @ionic/cli
    ```

4.  **Configure Capacitor (if needed):**
    * Verify or adjust `capacitor.config.ts` as necessary.  The `appId` and `appName` should be appropriate for your intended application.
    * Initialize Capacitor:
    ```bash
    ionic capacitor add android # Or ios, or web
    ```

5.  **Run the project:**

    *   **Web (Development):**  Using the Ionic extension in VSCode: Open the Ionic tab and press: `Run -> Web`.

    *   Alternatively using the command line (if you've installed the Ionic CLI):

        ```bash
        ionic serve
        ```

6.  **Running Cypress Tests**

    ```bash
    npm run cypress:open # To open the Cypress UI
    npm run cypress:run # To run the tests in the command line
    ```

## Usage Examples & API Documentation

This project appears to be a front-end application.  The `cypress/e2e/test.cy.ts` file provides an example of how to write basic Cypress tests, which can give some insight into the intended usage.

The application likely serves a user interface via the web browser.  More API documentation would be relevant as the backend of this application if it exists is developed.

## Configuration Options

*   **`capacitor.config.ts`:** This file configures the Capacitor environment for native builds (Android/iOS).  Adjust the `appId`, `appName`, and `webDir` properties as needed.
*   **.eslintrc.js:** This file configures the ESLint rules for the project. You can customize the rules to enforce specific coding styles and best practices.
*   **cypress.config.ts:** Configuration for Cypress testing framework.  `baseUrl` can be adjusted to match the address of your web server during development.
